# landing-page
This is my second Odin Project repo. I will be creating a web page from a given design.
The skills that I will be using in this project include HTML basics, CSS basics, and CSS flexbox.
The given design was provided to me as an image of the webpage. I simply have to use the skills that I've mentioned to make a near-perfect copy of the image.
Specifically, to create a header, body, and footer of the website, I will be using flexbox containers and elements. I will write out my content using HTML, and I will use CSS to place my HTML elements in their proper locations.
Let's hope that this project is a success. :)
